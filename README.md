## Objective
Build an automated AI agent that aggregates the latest cybersecurity news from selected websites, produces a shortened combined summary, deliver it via email and provides links to original sources.



## Features
This project provides a ready-to-use Docker Compose configuration for running [n8n](https://n8n.io/) â€” a powerful workflow automation tool. I chose n8n for its ability to be easily deployed and used locally, allowing for complete control over workflows.

You can use my provided configuration (set to the Europe/Warsaw timezone), modify it to match your own timezone or create your own setup following the [official n8n Docker installation guide](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/docker/).
