# docker-n8n-setup


## Objective



## Features

This project provides a ready-to-use Docker Compose configuration for running [n8n](https://n8n.io/) —— a powerful and flexible workflow automation tool. I chose n8n for its ability to be easily deployed and used locally, allowing for complete control over workflows and data without relying on external cloud services. <b>
You can use my provided configuration (set to the Europe/Warsaw timezone), modify it to match your own timezone or create your own setup following the [official n8n Docker installation guide](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/docker/).
