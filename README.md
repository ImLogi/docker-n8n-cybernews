## Objective
Build an automated AI agent that aggregates the latest cybersecurity news from selected websites, produces a shortened combined summary, deliver it via email and provides links to original sources.

>Note: Response time and output quality depend on the chosen AI model and host system's specifications.

## Tools
[n8n](https://n8n.io/) â€” a powerful workflow automation tool.
I chose n8n for its ability to be easily deployed and used locally.

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) â€” incredible tool for building, sharing and running applications.

[Ollama](https://ollama.com/) â€” open-source software for running LLMs locally. Build-in integration with n8n.


## Features
*This project usee ONLY free and open-source tools, promoting privacy, independence and cost-free accessibility for enthusiast who value the open-source philosophy*
>Note: The intended use case for this project is individual or educational purposes.
